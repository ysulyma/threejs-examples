# threejs-examples

This is a collection of some simple projects for getting started with [THREE.js](https://threejs.org) for mathematical visualization/illustration.

## Running the examples

Run the examples by opening `<foldername>/index.html` in your web browser.

## Coding

To edit the examples, you'll need a text editor. I recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

You'll want to keep the THREE.js documentation open: https://threejs.org/docs/

Here are some good resources for learning web development in general:

I believe the best way to learn web development is to go back and forth between going through a course/tutorial systematically (so you have a solid foundation) and tinkering with examples like the above to make them do what you want (so you have something interesting/fun to do)â€”even if you don't understand the code in its entirety.
